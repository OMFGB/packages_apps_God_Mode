The update utility work with clockworkmod.


Todo List that must be worked on immediately
1 - Remove as many calls to a reference Context as possible
2 - Handle the orientation change when downloading a rom or package.
3 - Remove the many references to Context in the OnNightlyPreferenceClickListener, instead use the supplied Preference to retreive a context to the activity
4 - Handle all fileDownloading in a service so that the Context to the Activity is not leaked. 

Todo list the is not needed immediately but would be useful
1 - Rearrange the initial app downloading to avoide unnessery memory allocation
2 - Handle refreshing the manifest in a more diligent way
